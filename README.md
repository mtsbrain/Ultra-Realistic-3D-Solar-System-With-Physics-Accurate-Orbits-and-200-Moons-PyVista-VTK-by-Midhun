A fully dynamic, physics-driven 3D Solar System simulation built using PyVista, VTK, NumPy, and real astronomical parameters.
This project features:
* Accurate orbital mechanics (Keplerian elements from JPL Horizons)
* True axial tilts & rotation periods for planets and moons
* 150+ moons with individual orbital elements
* Dynamic zoom limits per object
* Realistic irregular potato-shaped bodies
* Saturn’s ring system
* Comets with real orbital paths
* Scaled radii & distances for stable visualization
* High-performance rendering with level-of-detail logic
